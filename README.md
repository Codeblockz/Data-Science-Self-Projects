This is a collection of self data science projects that demonstrate various machine learning techniques. 

## R Gene Project
This is a R project showing a heatmap and a box plot. The heatmap shows the correlation between positive and negative genes with respect to the samples. The Technical Report html is a html file that explains and shows what I did to get the results I did. The Technical Report states the process in which I handled the data but does not explain my reasoning for those choices.

## RAG Chatbot Example
This is an example of a python script using Retrieval-augmented generation. The goal of the bot was to use a blog as the source for the RAG. This project uses Open AI API to access the LLM (large language model) and ChromaDB as a vector database. It also uses Langchain to make the LLM function as a Q&A bot.

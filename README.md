# Data-Science-Self-Projects
This is a collection of self data science projects that demonstrate various machine learning techniques. 

## R Gene Project
This is a R project showing a heatmap and a box plot. The heatmap shows the correlation between positive and negative genes with respect to the samples. The Technical Report html is a html file that explains and shows what I did to get the results I did. The Technical Report states the process in which I handled the data but does not explain my reasoning for those choices. 

## Titanic Kaggle Challenge 
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works. The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## RAG Chatbot Example
This is an example of a python script using Retrieval-augmented generation. The goal of the bot was to use a blog as the source for the RAG. This project uses Open AI API to access the LLM (large language model) and ChromaDB as a vector database. It also uses Langchain to make the LLM function as a Q&A bot.
